Automatic start-up of systemd user instances
--------------------------------------------
The systemd user instance is started after the first login of a user and killed
after the last session of the user is closed. Sometimes it may be useful to
start it right after boot, and keep the systemd user instance running after the
last session closes, for instance to have some user process running without any
open session. Lingering is used to that effect. Use the following command to
enable lingering for specific user:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ loginctl enable-linger username
